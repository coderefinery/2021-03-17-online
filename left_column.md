### Goals and format

In this mini-hackathon, you will become familiar with tools and best
practices for testing research software and get help in adopting these in
your own projects.

Day 1 will be devoted to
learning - we go through the [CodeRefinery lesson on automated
testing](https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/) and work on
exercises in breakout rooms where you can use your favorite
programming language. At the end of day 1 you will be paired up with
a mentor who will be available to answer your questions while you get
started on implementing tests in your code.

On day 2 we split into small groups by programming language. We will
work in breakout rooms and learners will get help from mentors in
designing and implementing tests for their code and setting up the
necessary infrastructure. At the end of day 2 we briefly summarize the
progress made for each project and discuss lessons learned.



### Software requirements

You are assumed to have everything installed that you need for running code
in your preferred programming language, e.g. Python or R interpreters,
or compilers for C/C++, Fortran, Julia, Rust, Go etc.

You also need to have a testing framework available for your preferred
language. Some languages need a package installation while others have
a framework built into their standard libraries. A list of recommended
tools and frameworks will be published here soon.

Other requirements:

- [Bash](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/bash/)
- [Editor](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/editors/)
- [Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git/), including
- [Zoom](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/zoom/)
