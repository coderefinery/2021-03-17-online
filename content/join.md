## How to join

#### *Either A. Both workshop and hackathon, or B. Only workshop*

- There are two ways to attend: only workshop on day 1 or both
  workshop and hackathon on days 1 and 2.

- It is not necessary that all team participants choose the same
  option.

#### *Participation as a team* 

- If you collaborate with other people on writing code, we recommend
  that you all register to the event as a team. You can also sign up
  as a team even if you don't directly collaborate on coding.
- Teams will be working together in breakout rooms during the event
  and get paired with the same mentor. Team members should preferably
  use the same programming language.
- Decide a team name, and when registering, everyone enters this team
  name so that we can link you together. Note that everyone on the
  team must register separately.

#### *Participation as a single learner*

- Single learners are welcome! You don't have to write anything to the
  "team name" question in the registration form.
- During the exercise sessions in the workshop, 5-6 single learners
  are grouped into a breakout room to work together. Our instructors
  and mentors will be jumping around breakout rooms and answer any
  questions.
- However, please note that **hackathon participants in teams will get
  more mentor time than single participants.**

#### *To maximize benefit of the Hackathon*

- When registering, please write a description of the project you want
  to work on together with a mentor. Write what your code does, what
  language it's expressed in, whether it already has some tests, and
  what you would like to accomplish in the hackathon.
- To derive maximum benefit from the hackathon, we recommend that you
  make your code available in some form so that mentors can prepare.
- In the registration form you can provide a web address to your code
   repository if it's publicly available. If your code is not public,
   we will ask you to share it with a mentor before the hackathon.


### Price and Zoom priority policy

Free of charge, funded by the [Nordic e-Infrastructure
Collaboration](https://neic.no/) and the [EuroCC National Competence
Center Sweden](https://enccs.se/).

When we have more sign-ups than our capacity allows, the following
priority criteria apply.

1. National universities or research institutes in Nordic countries
and Estonia
2. Private companies and government agencies in Nordic countries or
Estonia  
3. European national universities or research institutes from outside the Nordics.
4. Others

Therefore it is very important that you use an email address
corresponding to your affiliation.

### FAQ

- <b>Why should I join with a team?</b> If you will work together later,
  learning the tools at the same time is a great way to do it.

- <b>How does the waitlist work?</b> Anyone can register, but everyone goes to the waitlist. After the 3rd March, We'll continually approve people as we get space.

- <b>Does it matter where I work or study?</b> Because of the Nordic funding of
  CodeRefinery by [NeIC](https://neic.no/) and Swedish funding of
  [ENCCS](https://enccs.se/) we need to have a priority list described above.
