## Who the course is for

Are you doing any of these things?
- You write scripts to process data.
- You change scripts written by your colleagues.
- You write code that is used in research by you or others.
- You are not already extensively testing your code or scripts.

If yes, then the CodeRefinery testing workshop and hackathon is for you!
