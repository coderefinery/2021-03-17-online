### Bring your code and start writing tests with the help of a mentor!

### March 17 and 24, 2021

<a class="btn btn-info disabled" href="#" data-mode="1" target="_blank">Registration will open soon</a>

**Soft deadline on March 3!** To make it easier for hackathon mentors
to prepare we prioritize early registration. If there are still free seats
after March 3 we will keep accepting participants.

### Who the event is for

Are you doing any of these things?
- You write scripts to process data.
- You change scripts written by your colleagues.
- You write code that is used in research by you or others.
- You are not already extensively testing your code or scripts.

If yes, then the CodeRefinery testing hackathon is for you!



### Goals and format

In this hackathon, you will become familiar with tools and best
practices for testing research software and get help in adopting these in
your own projects.

Day 1 will be devoted to learning - we go through the [CodeRefinery
lesson on automated testing](https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/)
and work on exercises in breakout rooms where you can use your
favorite programming language. It is possible to only attend day 1 and
not take part in the hackathon. At the end of day 1, hackathon
participants will be paired up with a mentor and pitch their
projects in small groups.

In the days between the workshop on day 1 and the hackathon on day 2,
you will get help from your mentor to design tests, implement them in
your code or set up automated testing. Participants can communicate
with mentors by email, Zoom meetings or the [CodeRefinery
Zulipchat](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/) and ask
questions.  You will be expected to spend at least 5 hours on your
project during this time.

During the hackathon on day 2 we split into groups and participants
work in a sprint together with their mentor.  At the end of day 2 we
briefly summarize the progress made for each project and discuss
lessons learned.

### How to join

- There are two ways to attend: only workshop on day 1 or both workshop and
  hackathon on days 1 and 2.
- If you collaborate with other people on writing code, we recommend
  that you all register to the hackathon as a team.
- You can also sign up as a team even if you don't directly
  collaborate on coding. Teams will be working together in breakout
  rooms during the event and get paired with the same mentor. Team members
  should preferably use the same programming language.
- Decide some team name, and when registering, everyone enter this
  same name so that we can link you together. Note that everyone on
  the team must register separately.
- We will also accept single participants. If you're registering by
  yourself you do not need to select a team name.
- However, hackathon participants in teams will get more mentor time
  than single participants.
- When registering, please write a description of the project you
  want to work on together with a mentor. Write what your code does,
  what language it's expressed in, whether it already has some tests,
  and what you would like to accomplish in the hackathon.
- To derive maximum benefit from the hackathon, we recommend that you
  make your code available in some form so that mentors can prepare.
  In the registration form you can provide a web address to your code
  repository if it's publicly available. If your code is not public,
  we will ask you to share it with a mentor before the hackathon.



### Prerequisites

- You are expected to bring a code project to the event in which you
  want to implement testing functionality. It does not need to be a
  large complicated codebase, just something you use or intend to use
  in your research. If it's not your own code, make sure that it has a
  license which allows you to modify it.
- You may need to install some software - see the Software
  Requirements section on below.
- It is somewhat important that you have a basic idea of how Git
  works. Please go through [this Git-refresher
  material](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/) for a basic
  overview and important configuration steps.

### Software requirements

You are assumed to have everything installed that you need for running
code in your preferred programming language, e.g. Pythonm, Matlab or R
interpreters, or compilers for C/C++, Fortran, Julia, Rust, Go etc.

You also need to have a testing framework available for your preferred
language. Some languages need a package installation while others have
a framework built into their standard libraries. A list of recommended
tools and frameworks will be published here soon.

Other requirements:

- [Bash](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/bash/)
- [Editor](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/editors/)
- [Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git/)
- [Zoom](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/zoom/)

### FAQ

- **Why should I join with a team?**  If you will work together later,
  learning the tools at the same time is a great way to do it.

- **How does the waitlist work?**  Anyone can register, but you go to
  the waitlist until we can be sure we have enough mentors.  We'll
  continually approve people as we get space.

- **Does it matter where I work?** Because of the Nordic funding of
  CodeRefinery by [NeIC](https://neic.no/) and Swedish funding of
  [ENCCS](https://enccs.se/) we need to have a priority list: 1)
  National universities or research institutes in Nordic countries +
  Estonia; 2) Private companies and government agencies in Nordic
  countries participating in research projects funded by
  EU/Nordic/National research councils; 3) Other Nordic private
  companies or government agencies; 4) European national universities
  or research institutes from outside the Nordics.
