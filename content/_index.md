<hr>

<p style="font-size:120%;"><i> Bring your code and start writing tests with the help of a mentor! </i></p>


### Location

The hackathon will be held online, a Zoom link will be sent to accepted participants.


### Goals and format

In this event, you will become familiar with tools and best practices
for testing research software and get help in adopting these in your
own projects.

#### *Day 1: Workshop* 

Day 1 will be devoted to learning - we go through the [CodeRefinery
lesson on automated testing](https://coderefinery.github.io/testing)
and work on exercises in breakout rooms where you can use your
favorite programming language. <br>
<b>It is possible to only attend day 1 and not take part in the
hackathon.</b>

At the end of day 1, hackathon participants will be paired up with a
mentor and pitch their projects in small groups.

#### *Between Day 1 and Day 2*

In between the workshop and hackathon days you will get help from
your mentor to design tests, implement them in your code or set up
automated testing. Participants can communicate with mentors by email,
Zoom meetings or the [CodeRefinery
Zulipchat](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/) and ask
questions. <br>
<b>You will be expected to spend at least 5 hours on
your project during this time.</b>

#### *Day 2: Hackathon*

During the hackathon on day 2, we split participants into groups and
they work in a sprint together with their mentor. At the end of day
2, we briefly summarize the progress made for each project and discuss
lessons learned.<br>

**Participants in teams will be together in a breakout room.**
