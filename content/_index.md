### Bring your code and start writing tests with the help of a mentor!

### March 17 and 24, 2020

<a class="btn btn-info disabled" href="#" data-mode="1" target="_blank">Registration will open soon</a>

### Who the event is for

Are you doing any of these things below:
- You write scripts to process data.
- You change scripts written by your colleagues.
- You write code that is used in research by you or others.
- You are not already extensively testing your code or scripts.

If yes, then this mini-hackathon is for you!



### Goals and format

In this mini-hackathon, you will become familiar with tools and best
practices for testing research software and get help in adopting these in
your own projects.

Day 1 will be devoted to
learning - we go through the [CodeRefinery lesson on automated
testing](https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/) and work on
exercises in breakout rooms where you can use your favorite
programming language. At the end of day 1 you will be paired up with
a mentor who will be available to answer your questions while you get
started on implementing tests in your code.

On day 2 we split into small groups by programming language. We will
work in breakout rooms and learners will get help from mentors in
designing and implementing tests for their code and setting up the
necessary infrastructure. At the end of day 2 we briefly summarize the
progress made for each project and discuss lessons learned.

### Prerequisites

- You are expected to bring a code project to the event in which you want to implement
  testing functionality. It does not need to be a large complicated codebase,
  just something you use or intend to use in your research. If it's not your own code,
  make sure that it has a license which allows you to modify it.
- You may need to install some software - see the Software Requirements section on the left.
- It is useful if you have a basic idea of how Git works. Please go through
  [this Git-refresher material](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/)
  for a basic overview and important configuration steps.

### Software requirements

You are assumed to have everything installed that you need for running code
in your preferred programming language, e.g. Python or R interpreters,
or compilers for C/C++, Fortran, Julia, Rust, Go etc.

You also need to have a testing framework available for your preferred
language. Some languages need a package installation while others have
a framework built into their standard libraries. A list of recommended
tools and frameworks will be published here soon.

Other requirements:

- [Bash](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/bash/)
- [Editor](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/editors/)
- [Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git/)
- [Zoom](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/zoom/)

Collaboration](https://neic.no/) and the [EuroCC National Competence Center Sweden](https://enccs.se/).



### How to join

- If you collaborate with other people on writing code, we recommend
  that you all register to the hackathon as a team.
- You can also sign up as a team even if you don't directly
  collaborate on coding. Teams will be working together in breakout
  rooms during the event and get paired with the same mentor.  
- Decide some team name, and when registering, everyone enter this
  same name so that we can link you together. Note that everyone on
  the team must register separately.
- We will also accept single participants. If you're registering by
  yourself you do not need to select a team name.
- When registering, please write a description of the project you
  want to work on together with a mentor. Write what your code does,
  what language it's expressed in, whether it already has some tests,
  and what you would like to accomplish in the hackathon.
- To derive maximum benefit from the hackathon, we recommend that you
  make your code available in some form so that mentors can prepare.
  In the registration form you can provide a web address to your code
  repository if it's publicly available, or upload a compressed archive
  of your code if it's not public. We will deal with your code as
  classified information and not share or use any parts of it!

### FAQ

- **Why should I join with a team?**  If you will work together later,
  learning the tools at the same time is a great way to do it.

- **How does the waitlist work?**  Anyone can register, but you go to
  the waitlist until we can be sure we have enough mentors.  We'll
  continually approve people as we get space.
