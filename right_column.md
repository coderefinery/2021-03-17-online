### Who the event is for

Are you doing any of these things below:
- You write scripts to process data.
- You change scripts written by your colleagues.
- You write code that is used in research by you or others.

If yes, then this mini-hackathon is for you. 

### How to join

We are normally limited by number of helpers, thus:

- Anyone may register as a learner, we will try to take as many as we can.
- Or you can register as a mentor.  If you are somewhat comfortable
  with software testing in one or more languages, you can be a helper! (see below)
- Register as a team, one mentor and 4-6 learners.
  - We will accept all complete teams.
  - Everyone on the team must register separately.
  - Decide some team name, and when registering, everone enter this
    same name so that we can link you together.
  - During the exercise sessions in breakout rooms, the helper has
    primary responsibility for their group's hands-on exercises.
    Still, instructors drop by to check and help
    as needed, so don't worry if you don't know everything.
  - This is a great opportunity to bring your friends and colleagues
    and prepare for the future together.

If you've been to a CodeRefinery workshiop before and implemented some testing after
that, or if you routinely write tests for your code, you are definitely capable of being a mentor.

### What we will not teach

This is not a course about a specific programming language or
the Linux/Unix terminal shell.  We assume that you are familiar with the programming
language that you use in your work and research.  We try to keep the course as
language-independent as possible but we will show some basic code examples in
Python.


### Prerequisites

- Basics in one or more programming languages.
  You are expected to bring a code project to the event in which you want to implement
  testing functionality. It does not need to be a large complicated codebase,
  just something you use or intend to use in your research.
- You may need to install some software. Please follow links at left.
- It is useful if you have a basic idea of how Git works. Please go through
  [this Git-refresher material](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/)
  for a basic overview and important configuration steps.



### Instructors

- TBA


### Helpers

([Tips for
helpers](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/helping-and-teaching/)).


### FAQ

- **Why should I come as a team?**  If you will work together later,
  learning the tools at the same time is a great way to do it.

- **How does the waitlist work?**  Anyone can register, but you go to
  the waitlist until we can be sure we have enough helpers.  We'll
  continually approve people as we get space.  We know
  this may be more unpredictable for you, but the way to make sure you
  get in is join a team with a helper (or find us more helpers in
  general).
