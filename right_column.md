### Who the event is for

Are you doing any of these things below:
- You write scripts to process data.
- You change scripts written by your colleagues.
- You write code that is used in research by you or others.
- You are not already extensively testing your code or scripts.

If yes, then this mini-hackathon is for you!

### How to join

- If you collaborate with other people on writing code, we recommend
  that you all register to the hackathon as a team.
- You can also sign up as a team even if you don't directly
  collaborate on coding. Teams will be working together in breakout
  rooms during the event and get paired with the same mentor.  
- Decide some team name, and when registering, everyone enter this
  same name so that we can link you together. Note that everyone on
  the team must register separately.
- We will also accept single participants. If you're registering by
  yourself you do not need to select a team name.
- When registering, please write a description of the project you
  want to work on together with a mentor. Write what your code does,
  what language it's expressed in, whether it already has some tests,
  and what you would like to accomplish in the hackathon.
- To derive maximum benefit from the hackathon, we recommend that you
  make your code available in some form so that mentors can prepare.
  In the registration form you can provide a web address to your code
  repository if it's publicly available, or upload a compressed archive
  of your code if it's not public. We will deal with your code as
  classified information and not share or use any parts of it!
  
  
### Prerequisites

- You are expected to bring a code project to the event in which you want to implement
  testing functionality. It does not need to be a large complicated codebase,
  just something you use or intend to use in your research. If it's not your own code,
  make sure that it has a license which allows you to modify it.
- You may need to install some software - see the Software Requirements section on the left.
- It is useful if you have a basic idea of how Git works. Please go through
  [this Git-refresher material](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/)
  for a basic overview and important configuration steps.

### FAQ

- **Why should I join with a team?**  If you will work together later,
  learning the tools at the same time is a great way to do it.

- **How does the waitlist work?**  Anyone can register, but you go to
  the waitlist until we can be sure we have enough mentors.  We'll
  continually approve people as we get space.
